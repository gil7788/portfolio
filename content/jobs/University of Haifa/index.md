- Developed the 'Secure Batch Retrieval (SBR)' protocol to demonstrate its efficacy in safeguarding data confidentiality through Homomorphic Encryption.
- Solely managed the programming and debugging of an extensive 8,000-line C++ codebase for the SBR protocol.
- Independently designed and implemented an automated benchmark analysis tool with a user-friendly interface to assess the SBR protocol's efficiency.
- Utilized Amazon Web Services (AWS) for executing algorithm benchmarks, generating data for subsequent analysis.
- This project, a significant component of my master's degree, was conducted with guidance from my research supervisor and served as the core of my thesis.
